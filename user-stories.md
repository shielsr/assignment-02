# Favourite flavours

# Live count
[MUST] As a user, I want a live count of how many pastilles I've added to my packet, so I don't have to backtrack and correct errors later.

# Visual representation
[MUST] As a user, I want to be able to see a mockup of the packet, so I know how it will look before I order it. 

# Shipping
[MUST] As any user type, I want to be able to ship my creation to myself, so I can eat what I have designed.


# Future work

# Gifting
[SHOULD] As a gift giver, I want to be able to ship my creation to others as a gift, so that I can share my creation with loved ones.

# Trying all flavours
[SHOULD] As a brand new customer, I want to create a tube with a random combination of all flavours, so I can try all the flavours.

# Health options
[SHOULD] As a health-conscious customer, I want to have health-related options, so I can order a healthier version of the product.
