As a brand new customer, I want to create a tube with a random combination of all flavours, so I can try all the flavours.

# Health options
As a health-conscious customer, I want to have health-related options, so I can order a healthier version of the product.

As any user type, I want to be able to ship my creation to myself, so I can eat what I have designed.
