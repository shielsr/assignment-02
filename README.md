## Project goal
The goal of the project is to allow users to create their own bespoke packet of pastille sweets. They can then place an order to have the packet delivered to their house or gift it to somebody else.

## Features

- Choose what flavours are included in their packet
- Choose the quantity of each flavour
- Randomise the order of sweets in the packet
- Order your desired packet to your home
- Gift your creation to someone else
- Order healtheir versions


## How I went about it

- I started with a simple form with 2 dropdowns and a submit button. I followed the Week 7 Unit 12 lecture recording to create the JS, adding event listeners etc.
- Once that worked, I wanted to put a max of 10 on the total.
- Then I wanted to map the amounts of colours to an array with those amounts represented by strings, e.g. if the user selected 3 reds and 2 blues then the array would be red, red, red, blue, blue. I read up on how to 'map' one array into another. I went with a forEach and a for loop.
